# asyncsteem
Twisted based asynchonous python steem API. 

## NOTE: The STEEM blockchain has recently been seriously compromized by a successfull decentralization attack. Large amounts of STEEM  have changed ownership without the consent of the original owners and without the use of their keys. Continued use of the STEEM blockchain or ownership of STEEM should both currently be considered high risk.

This project will soon disapear from this repo. I'm keeping it up for a few weeks to allow others to fork it.

I'm currently working on a replacement JSON-RPC library for the Hive platform. You can find that library [here](https://github.com/pibara/hivequeue/tree/master)
